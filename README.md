# Introduction to Building AI Apps

This repository introduces and helps organizations get started with building AI Apps and incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) into them.

## Workshop Agenda

The objective of this workshop is to practice realistic AI orchestration scenarios towards learning how to build intelligent apps.
At the end of the workshop you will: 
* Know how to use prompt engineering techniques for effective generative AI responses on OpenAI
* Understand the implications of the usage of tokens and embeddings when interacting with an LLM
* Have experience in leveraging AI orchestrators like Langchain/ Semantic Kernel with Azure OpenAI
* Have evaluated different Vectorstores like Qdrant/ Azure Cognitive Search to enhance LLM responses with your data and context
* Know how to turn a business scenario with data, context and user input into an intelligent application on Azure
