However, that's just the start of how Langchain makes it easier to work with LLM's. Most OpenAI models are designed to be interacted with using a Chat style interface, where you provide a persona or system prompt which helps the LLM understand the context of the conversation. This will then be sent to the LLM along with the user's request.\n",
    "\n",

It provides an alternative method to the raw API or using an SDK package to access the AI models, but on top of that can provide additional integrations, deal with issues related to rate limiting of the API and provide an abstraction layer over potentially complex operations. We'll get into those more complex use cases in later labs."
