    "## Embeddings\n",

    "The solution to working with large amounts of external information is to use *embeddings*. OpenAI provide embedding models which allow human readable information to be analysed for meaning and intent. The output from an embedding model is data in a numeric format, known as *vectors*. These allow computers to group pieces of similar information together. The vectors are then kept in a *vector store*. When you want to ask a question, an embedding model is again used to convert the query text into vectors and the vector data that represents your query can then be searched in the vector store. Any similar vectors that are found in the database are likely to be a good response to your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent overloading a prompt with a large number of tokens, instead of sending all of our documents to the AI, we can perform a vector search first to narrow down to a set of interesting results, and then use that smaller subset of information as part of a prompt."
